# Sem1-insurance-pred-ML
Dataset is available present in Kaggle at the location :
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/noordeen/insurance-premium-prediction

Objectives of this assignment are as following :
1) Preprocess the data and clean the data. Removed all the nulls and missing values.
2) Build the dataset into training and test datasets. Split the dataset (80% train and 20% test, 10% train and 90% test)
3) Visualize the data using different techniques. Visualized the data with multiple histogram,chart, scatter plot, bar graph for following datatypes
   i)BMI
   ii)Medical charges vs Smoker status
   iii)Annual medical charges Vs Sex
   iv)Annual medical charges vs Region
   v) Region and Smoker
   vi)Smoker and number of children
   vii)Age Vs charges
   viii)BMI Vs Charges
   ix) Sex and sum of charges
   x) Sex , bmi and charges
